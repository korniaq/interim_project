My interim project, which I'm currently working on. Its topic is to apply Bayesian optimization into a basic CFD problem of maximizing the stirring of a flow behind a square obstacle. The obstacle is described with its dimension and angle of rotation. Incompressible Navier Stokes solver of Nektar++ is used in order to solve Navier Stokes equation and PYGPGO library is used to aply the optimization.
The stirring has been measured by mean variance of the passive scalar over time. Laminar flow is given as inlet boundary condition and open Dong stabilization is given as outlet condition.
Results for each pair of the parameters during optimization loop have been presented in results.txt file. Last time step od the base setting is shown in base.png file and last time step of the solution is shown in solution.png file.
