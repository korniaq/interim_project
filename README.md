My interim project, which I'm currently working on. Its topic is to apply Bayesian optimalization into a basic CFD problem of maximizing discharge in a canal. The canal is described by trigonometric functions. Advection-Difusion-Reaction solver of Nektar++ is used in order to solve Poisson equation.
