My interim project, which I'm currently working on. Its topic is to apply Bayesian optimization into a basic CFD problem of maximizing the mixing of a flow behind a square obstacle. The obstacle is described with its dimension and angle of rotation. Incompressible Navier Stokes solver of Nektar++ is used in order to solve Navier Stokes equation.
The topic has been changed, thus the files are not up to date. I'm working on applying appropriate boundary conditions, so that the flow is unstable while avoiding blowup in the calculations. Also, I need to find a way to measure the mixing.
